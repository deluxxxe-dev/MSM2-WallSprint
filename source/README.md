# WallSprint

v0.1c20 / package0.1.38 finalizes the independent local workspace, safe full-validation updater and versioned workspace logs. Gameplay remains at the accepted c19 state; prepared EDI research is preserved but production-disabled. No Position/source/input/movement writes or producer traversal.

Use `MSM2-WS-v0.1c20.zip` and the included `Migrate-WS.cmd` outside Mods Library. The authoritative clone is `<game>/Mods Library/Mods-Developing/MSM2-WS/_source`; normal updates use `MSM2-WS/Update-WS.cmd`. Exactly one active versioned `.script` remains at workspace root. Shared Overstrike is `<game>/Overstrike/Overstrike.exe` with game-root WorkingDirectory. SF/ordinary mods and the legacy environment are never cleaned or automatically removed.

See [README_TEST.md](README_TEST.md), [docs/LOCAL_WORKSPACE.md](docs/LOCAL_WORKSPACE.md) and [source/BUILD.md](source/BUILD.md) for Python/Git/WSL prerequisites, first migration command and real-PC acceptance checks. Runtime logs use `MSM2-WS/logs/MSM2-WS-v<version>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` without fallback. Cloud fixture success is not a claim that the user's PC was migrated.
